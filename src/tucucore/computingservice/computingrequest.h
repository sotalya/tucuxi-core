/// \brief The ComputingRequest class
/// This class embeds all the information needed to start a computation.
/// For every computation an object of this class is sent to the IComputingService.
/// It mainly consists in the DrugModel and the DrugTreatment, and a set of
/// ComputingTraits. Therefore it is possible to send a request for a patient
/// represented by its treatment and drug model, and embed subrequests in it.
/// For instance you can ask for a prediction, percentiles and an adjustment in
/// a single request.
///
/// A ComputingRequest is not responsible for the objects it embedds. It is a simple
/// container.
