///
/// \brief The DrugModelRepository class
///
/// The role of the DrugModelRepository is to load and store DrugModel objects
/// so as to offer them when required.
///
/// Getting a drug model can be done by Id:
///
/// \code
/// DrugModel *theModel = drugModelRepository->getDrugModelById("theDrugModelId");
/// \endcode
///
/// Or by drug Id:
///
/// \code
/// std::vector<DrugModel *> theModels = drugModelRepository->getDrugById("theDrugId");
/// \endcode
///
/// In that second case, a vector of DrugModel objects is returned. Each DrugModel is
/// applicable on the drug represented by the DrugId.
///
/// There are two ways of populating the repository:
/// 1. By loading drug model files (.tdd) from a specific folder
/// 2. By setting folders in which the repository will look for specific drug models when required
///
/// For the first option, simply call loadFolder(<folderpath>) on the folders containing the .tdd files.
/// It will directly load all the valid drug models found in that directory. Please note that this loading
/// is not done recursively.
///
/// For the second option, the concept is to call addFolderPath(<folderpath>).
/// This function will simply store the folder path in a list, and the drug model is loaded only
/// when asked through getDrugModelById() or getDrugModelsByDrugId(). As by convention, the name
/// of the drug model file is <drugModelId>.tdd, the repository can try to find this file and load it
/// if it finds it. A model that has been loaded should then stay in the repository. It means that
/// the second time its Id is asked, then there will be no need to reload it.
///
/// The main difference between the two options is the computing time. With the first one,
/// some time is spent at the beginning to load all drug models. With the second one, no time is
/// lost at beginning, but some latency could be observed the first time a drug model is used.
///
/// For automated tests in command line it is suggested to use the second approach, as there is a good
/// chance that only a single drug model will be used. It will save processing time.
///
/// It can also be noticed that both approaches are compatible. For instance it is possible to load
/// a folder at the beginning, add other folders without loading. When getting a drug model, the
/// repository will look in the list of already loaded drug models, and if it is not found, then
/// it will try to load a file from one of the available folders.
