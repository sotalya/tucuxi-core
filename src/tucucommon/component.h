/// \brief Base class helping the implementation of Tucuxi's components.
///
/// This is a helper class focusing on making the implementation of components easier. Mainly it manages a map of
/// interface pointers. Since users of components can only access components via their interfaces, using dynamic_cast
/// to switch interface is not possible as neither the compiler nor the runtime can understand the relation between a
/// component and its interfaces. As a result, switching from one interface is only possible by using
/// Interface::getInterface. The actual implementation of getInterface is provided by the component itself via
/// dynamic_cast. In order to simplify this code, Component offers methods registerInterface and getInterfaceImpl.
///
